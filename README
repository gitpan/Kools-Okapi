Kools-Okapi version 2.6.3.L3.001
================================

This is the Kools OKAPI Perl wrapper package around the OKAPI Kondor+
API.
The OKAPI allows one to connect to the Kondor+ tradekast (export) and
kis (import) servers which allow one to export or import (mostly) trade
data into Kondor+.

The reason for writing this wrapper is simply because Perl is a
perfect language for data manipulation/transformation, something we
do so often with Kondor+ addons.
Furthermore almost every wrapper exists in Perl - we have tibco, triarch,
Sybase wrappers making Perl a near perfect choice - the only thing
missing is an OKAPI wrapper.

The version of this module matches the Kondor+ version that it is built
for plus a sequencial number.
This does not mean this module will not compile with a later version of
OKAPI - it does however mean that latest features may not be supported.
