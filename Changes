# Changes log for Kools-Okapi
=============================

263.003   2009/02/25
          - changed numbering scheme so something a bit more simple and user
            friendly. It will still follow the Kondor+ version number with a
            sequence number added. Will see how this evolves with time ...
          - added most callbacks (still missing the SET_FDS callback)
          - added ICC_main_xxx functions

2.6.3.L3.002  2009/02/22
              - Now have a working tradekast and kis client (see the test
                scripts). Still basic/strict minimum functionality is supported
                but still a proper working client is possible.

2.6.3.L3.001  2009/02/17
              - Initial release
